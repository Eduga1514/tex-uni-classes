# LaTeX uni Notes
The objective of this repository is to serve as an archive for all the stuff I do in LaTeX. I've been using it for some time instead of pen-and-paper to transcribe all of my classes, and it has served as an excellent learning tool for the past year or so. If there's someone that can find the utility in them, I don't have any problem in anybody cloning this repo and using them for themselves, but keep in mind: These notes are VERY personal and are in Spanish, so many of them are not so well redacted, don't have original graphs/images and can be incomplete (especially towards the end), so be careful while going through them.

The degree I'm going for is a degree in Mathematics from the Simón Bolívar University in Caracas, Venezuela, and the courses that I currently have here are:

  - Análisis II.
  - Combinatoria.
  - Introducción a la Teoría de Ramsey.
  
And I have personal notes on:

   - Topología
